# CPR Dummy
CPR Dummy is an Android app that uses [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) to displays chest compression depth and blood pressure for a CPR manikin. We use an Arduino to record chest depth which is sent over bluetooth to the Android device. There, the depth information is processed to simulate a blood pressure for the user.
