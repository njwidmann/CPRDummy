# CPR Dummy
CPR Dummy is an Android app that uses [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) to displays chest compression depth and blood pressure for a CPR mannequin. The mannequin uses a linear encoder connected to an Arduino to find depth and estimate blood pressure using a piston-cylinder model. The data is sent via bluetooth to the Android app where it is displayed in the graph.
